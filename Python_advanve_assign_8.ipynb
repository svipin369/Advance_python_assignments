    "When an error (exception) happens in Python, the program looks for a specific code block designed to handle that error. This code block is called an \"exception handler.\" Python checks for exception handlers in the following order:\n",
    "\n",
    "•\tFirst, it looks for a handler in the current part of the code where the error occurred.\n",
    "•\tIf there's no handler there, it goes to the part of the code that called the current part and checks for a handler there.\n",
    "•\tIt keeps going up through the different parts of the code (like a ladder) until it finds a handler or reaches the very top of the program.\n",
    "•\tIf it reaches the top and there's still no handler, the program stops and shows an error message.\n",
    "The idea is to find a place in the code where the error can be dealt with properly. If there's no such place, the program has to stop to avoid causing unexpected problems. \n",
